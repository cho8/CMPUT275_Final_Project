Final Project Proposal (Resubmission. See EDIT under description)

We are creating a finite top-down view survival/sandbox game, similar in concept to Don’t Starve or The Long Dark. The design will look similar to a classic Legend of Zelda or Pokemon game.
The object of the game will be to survive the elements and explore the pre-designed world.
Player explores the world map collecting items to survive hunger and predators.
Our main focus will be an AI class that can be inherited by different NPCs that interact with the position/situation of the character. NPCs include predators, flora, fauna, etc. 

EDIT: 
We forgot to mention the algorithmic problems of our project. We plan to tackle at least two of the following:

- Computing the shortest path to pick up multiple highlighted items
- Generating cost-efficient paths between two tiles/positions. Specifically, predators will find the shortest path to the character’s current position and small animals will find the shortest path to the furthest distance from the player.
- Auto-heal/eat feature that consumes the least (or most, depending on design decision) amount of items to give the lowest remaining health/hunger. We’ve considered the possibility of having an “encumbered” state where the player moves around slower when the inventory is too full. The auto-eat feature could allow the player to consume the combination of items that relieves the most amount of inventory space.


Milestones:

1.	Basic World Assets (Deadline: March 23)
	- Scrollable World/Map
	- Objects with collision (can’t go through trees and walls!)
	- Movable character across map
	- Find and pick up items (they don’t do anything yet)
	- GUI design
	Demoable: Player can walk around the map and collect items

2.	Generation of survival statistics and items 
	(Deadline: March 27)
	- Hunger/Health/Stamina/etc. based on time of day
	- Item functionality (Memoization!) (restores health, hunger, make fires, etc.)
	- Item respawning
	- NPC assets, controlled “idle” movement behaviour
	- Attempt balancing of item spawns 
	Demoable: Players stats will decrease, replenished through items

3.	NPC aggro (Deadline: April 3)
	- When NPCs spot Player, react to player position:
	- Small animals generally run away, predatory animals stalk player
	- Fight or flight mode: Each animal either flees or becomes violent
	- Attempt balancing of movement
	Demoable: Interactable NPCs (NPCs react to player movement)

4.	Fight or Flight, Attack! (April 7)
	- Fight mode: NPCs can hurt player, player can hurt NPC. 
	Predators in fight mode may switch to flight mode if damaged 
	enough, depends on predator class.
	- Add fight mechanics (Punch the bear! You probably won’t win!)
	- Attempt balancing of fight mechanics
	Demoable: Player can fight NPCS or NPCs will run away.

Stretch Goals (Bonus Milestones)
	- Add dialogue/monologue
	- Craft equipment
	- Create renewable item sources (farms, fishing, mining, logging)
	- Random generate world map.
